# Maintenance Jobs Scheduler Plugin

Perform some deleting or disabling of old jobs based on some cron tasks. You can configure this plugin globally based on some specific scheduler, excluding jobs with some regex, add some description in each disabling job (for tracking purposes), apply that filter for those jobs older than X days.

## Motivation

When I started to use Jenkins, I was maintaining some Jenkins jobs manually, it was a tedious task then I coded some groovy script in order to automate it as much as I could, then I realized some organizations don't grant access to the groovy script api for some security concerns and therefore I wrote this plugin to help them and use it as a plugin, so the FOSS community can improve it if they need.

###Â How to install

Run

	mvn clean package

to create the plugin .hpi file.

To install:

1. copy the resulting ./target/maintenance-jobs-scheduler.hpi file to the $JENKINS_HOME/plugins directory. Don't forget to restart Jenkins afterwards.

2. or use the plugin management console (http://example.com:8080/pluginManager/advanced) to upload the hpi file. You have to restart Jenkins in order to find the plugin in the installed plugins list.
